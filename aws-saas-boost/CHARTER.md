# AWS SaaS Boost Charter

## Mission

Our mission is to create a community-driven suite of extensible building blocks for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) builders. Our goal is to foster an open environment for developing and sharing reusable code that accelerates the ability to deliver and operate multi-tenant SaaS solutions on AWS.

## Tenets (unless you know better ones)

These tenets guide AWS SaaS Boost development. They let you know what we value and what we're working toward.

### AWS SaaS Boost is secure since all customers want to use solutions they can trust

We provide software that enables multi-tenant workloads to be trusted as a service, ensuring isolation and security at all levels.  
We continuously invest in security posture as best practices evolve.

### AWS SaaS Boost is valuable because itâ€™s built to last

We prioritize efficiency in the dimensions that benefit customers. 
We favor contributions that make it easy for customers to onboard, simple for operators to maintain, extensible to encourage integration, and optimized to offer the best quality per tenant.

### AWS SaaS Boost is open because the best SaaS can only be built through collaboration

We develop in the open and encourage community participation in the direction, goals, and implementation of our projects. 
We build open source software that is customizable because every business is different. 
We work together with our community to support the SaaS technologies that matter to them, not just to AWS.
